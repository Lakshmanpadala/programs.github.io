<h4>
The main aim of this special session is to provide opportunity to the scientific community to utilize bio‐inspired solutions for development of signal processing systems, communication devices and antennas. Several world‐renowned organizations have sponsored and created laboratories and research centers to understand the behavior of living organisms. The researches that use the bio‐inspired geometry for the development of signal processing systems, communication devices and antennas can be divided into two groups - systems with bio‐inspired geometries in animals and systems with bio‐inspired geometries in plants. This session will encourage the researchers to further explore their research in this domain.<hr>
